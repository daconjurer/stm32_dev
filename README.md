# stm32_dev
This repo collects development tools, examples, and reference on
embedded systems development using the STM32 "Blue Pill" MCU. The
setup includes Bare Metal, Mbed, FreeRTOS and Arduino
applications.

## Prerequisites

* **Arduino** In order to code using the Arduino interface, you should
first install the [Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32)
repo and follow their Setup instructions [here](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started).

* **libopencm3** For development using the libopencm3 firmware library,
you should download it from [here](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3)
and follow their Installation instructions.

* **FreeRTOS** In order to use the Real-Time capabilities from FreeRTOS,
download the version of your preference from [here](https://www.freertos.org)
as a zip file. Unzip and you are all set.

Note: This setup assumes you have an *include* folder in the root
directory of this repo and the ```libopencm3``` and ```rtos``` folders are
placed inside *include*.

## Note

This project is just a collection of resources that I find useful and
use myself for the projects using the Blue Pill board.
